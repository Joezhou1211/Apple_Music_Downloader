# Apple_Music_Downloader
This script allows you to download songs from Apple Music in MP3 format. The script uses Selenium for browser automation and Requests for file downloading.

## Disclaimer

This project is intended for sharing and educational purposes only. It should not be used for any commercial or profit-making activities. 

## How It Works

The script leverages the [Apple Music Downloader](https://apple-music-downloader.com) website to perform the conversion and download of Apple Music tracks. Hereâ€™s how the functionality is implemented:

1. **Selenium for Browser Automation**:
    - The script uses Selenium to automate the process of interacting with the [Apple Music Downloader](https://apple-music-downloader.com) website.
    - It opens the website, enters the Apple Music URL, and clicks the necessary buttons to start the conversion process.

2. **Extracting Download Links**:
    - After initiating the conversion, the script waits for the download link to be generated.
    - It then extracts the download link from the page once it's available.

3. **Downloading the MP3 File**:
    - Using the Requests library, the script downloads the MP3 file from the extracted link.
    - The file is saved locally with a name formatted as `SongName-ArtistName.mp3`.

This approach ensures that the download process is automated, reliable, and fast, utilizing the robust capabilities of the [Apple Music Downloader](https://apple-music-downloader.com) platform.


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9
- Selenium library
- Requests library

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone and Set Up the Environment
```
git clone https://github.com/Joezhou1211/Apple_Music_Downloader.git

   - Download the ChromeDriver that matches your Chrome version from [https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads].
   - Add the ChromeDriver executable to your system PATH.

2. **Modify the Script**:
   - Replace the `driver = webdriver.Safari()` line with:
     ```python
     from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
     from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager

     driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()))
     ```
